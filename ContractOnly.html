<h3>Article 1 - Recognition</h3>
<h4>1.1</h4>
<p>The Board recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of all classified employees of the District, excluding administrative employees, supervisory employees, confidential employees and those employees defined in Section 1.2.</p>
<h4>1.2</h4>
<p>For purposes of this agreement:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><!-- a. --><p>A "substitute" shall be defined as a person not regularly employed by the district, called in to fill a vacancy created by the temporary absence of a regular employee.</p></li>
<li><!-- b. --><p>A "temporary" shall be defined as a person hired for a specific purpose or special project. Temporaries shall be employed for a period not to exceed ninety (90) continuous calendar days, except in the case of seasonal help or when used to substitute for an employee on approved leave of absence as defined in Article 12.6.</p>
<p>Any temporary employee except those substituting for employees on approved leaves as defined in Article 12.6, working in excess of ninety (90) days in a particular position will move to probationary status as a classified employee. If a temporary employee who is substituting for an employee on approved leave is subsequently offered and granted a regular position with the District, the employee will be placed on probation and if successful, their seniority date shall be from the date of original hire as a temporary employee.</p>
<p>A position may be identified by the District as a temporary position. An employee hired in such a position will remain a temporary employee for ninety (90) calendar days, at which time they will become a probationary classified employee.</p>
<p>An employee initially hired as a temporary employee who is subsequently hired into another position the following school year cycle prior to October 1, without a break in service (beyond recess periods), shall be considered a regular employee whose probationary period has been met and whose seniority will date back to the original date of hire in the temporary position.</p></li>
<li><!-- c. --><p>A "special project" shall be defined as work performed on a specific task.</p></li>
<li><!-- d. --><p>Seasonal help shall be employed for a period of not more than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days. Any employee working as seasonal help in excess of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days will move to probationary status as a classified employee.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>1.3</h4><p>No person hired as described in 1.2 (a), (b), (c) and (d) shall be paid more than the entry wage level for the classification into which they are hired.</p>

<h3>Article 2 - Management</h3>
<h4>2.1</h4>
<p>The Board shall retain the exclusive right to exercise the functions of management as conferred by law or precedent and this right shall be modified only as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Any such right not exercised during the period of this Agreement shall not be deemed abrogated.</p>

<h3>Article 3 - Association Dues and Payroll Deductions</h3>
<h4>3.1</h4>
<p>Upon written request from the employee, the District shall deduct from the wages of the employee and make appropriate remittance for the following approved deductions:</p>

	<li><!-- g. --><p>Tax-sheltered IRS "Section 125" deductions.</p></li>
	</ol>
<h4>3.2</h4>
<p>The Association agrees to hold the District harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders, or judgments brought against the District as a result the deduction of Association dues in accordance with Section 3.1(e) above. The District agrees to correct computation or mathematical errors, which may occur in preparing the transmitting of these deductions.</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p><!-- a. -->The District will supply the Association with a list of all employees after the September payroll has been completed and at other times required by the Association provided such request is made no more than once each month.</p></li>
	</ol>

<h3>Article 4 - Association Rights and Responsibilities</h3>
<h4>4.1</h4>
	<p>The Association or committee of the Association shall be allowed the use of facilities of the District for meetings when such facilities are not scheduled for use by Community Services or in use as approved by the building supervisor. Association meetings shall be conducted during hours outside the regular (weekday) work schedule, which is from eight (8) a.m. to four (4) p.m.</p>
<h4>4.2</h4>
	<p>The Association shall be allowed the use of office equipment and District email as needed for duplication and other modes of communication to the classified employees and in a manner which does not interrupt the regular routine of the District programs, as approved by the building supervisor, and the Association shall pay for the supplies and materials that may be used in these activities.</p>
<h4>4.3</h4>
	<p>The Association shall be provided space in the "Right to Know" center for the use of communicating with classified employees in each facility in which such employees are assigned, as arranged with the building supervisor.</p>
<h4>4.4</h4>
	<p>The Association representatives, elected or appointed, shall be granted limited time off to attend meetings of interest to the Association, when arrangements for such absence can be made with the building supervisor so as to not interfere with normal school duties. Any sub costs shall be borne by the association.</p>
<h4>4.5</h4>
	<p>The Association agrees to prepare and distribute information packets for newly hired employees in the bargaining unit. Such packets shall include information regarding their rights, obligations, and entitlements under this collective bargaining agreement, but shall not include any forms mandated by law or insurance enrollment forms other than those available to members through OSEA. The District shall inform the Chapter President of new employees within 30 days of hire.</p>
<h4>4.6</h4>
	<p>The Association may request up to fifteen (15) days of release time each school year for employees to participate in Association business. The Association agrees to pay the District the costs of a substitute for the missing employee. All requests need prior approval and will be made through the Director of Human Resources (with notification to the supervisor) at least seven (7) days prior to the release date.</p>
<h4>4.7</h4>
	<p>Designated association representatives shall be provided an opportunity to meet with newly hired classified employees for up to sixty (60) minutes, without any loss of pay.  Both the new employees and the designated representative will coordinate with their immediate supervisors to identify an appropriate time to meet.</p>


<h3>Article 5 - Senority/Layoff/Reduction in Force/Recall</h3>
	<h4>5.1</h4>
		<p>Seniority</p>
		<p>District-wide seniority shall be defined as the total length of consecutive service within the District as a classified employee to include time on authorized leave of absence. Classification-wide seniority shall be defined as total length of consecutive service within a classification (defined in 5.4 below).</p>
	
	<h4>5.2</h4>
		<p>Layoff/Displacement/Bumping</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li><p><!-- a. -->Layoff/displacement of employees in the bargaining unit will be on the basis of classification-wide seniority within the District except that where, in the judgment of the District, a less senior employee has a special job-related skill or ability, the district may retain the less senior employee. No employee will be moved to a higher pay as part of a reduction-in-force action. Thus, within each job title, employees will be laid off or displaced based on seniority, the least senior employee within that job title to be laid off or displaced first except that regardless of seniority: (1) No employee may move to a job title within a higher pay range; and, (2) If the District determines that a less senior employee has a special job-related skill or ability, that employee may be retained in favor of a more senior employee. Employees affected by a layoff/displacement will be notified in writing at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to layoff. The Chapter President will be notified prior to the employee notification.</p></li>

				<li><p><!-- b. -->An employee in an affected job title who has been notified of displacement or layoff shall have the right to bump downward into a lesser paying job title within their classification provided they have greater classification seniority than other employees in that job title. If a vacancy exists within that lower job title, the employee will be placed in the vacancy to avoid "bumping" an incumbent employee. An employee who has "been bumped" may, in turn, exercise their right to also continue to bump downward into a lower paying job within the classification according to the same rules as above.</p></li>

				<p>If an employee has been employed by the District in a classification different than their current classification, the employee shall have the right to be moved back to their previous classification subject to the following conditions: (1) Only the seniority they earned while employed in the prior classification will be considered; (2) An employee moving back into a classification shall be subject to the same conditions established above in 5.2(a) and they may only be moved back into the same or a lower paying job title within the classification that they previously held; and (3) The employee must still be qualified to perform the duties of the job.</p>

				<li><p><!-- c. -->An employee reassigned or bumped to a lower job title under the terms of this Article shall be placed on the proper wage range but will remain on their current step.</p></li>

				<li><p><!-- d. -->The layoff provision of Section 5.2(a) and (b) above do not apply to reductions in hours; however, if a reduction in hours results in a reduction in health and dental benefits described in Article 10 (i.e., moving below seven (7) hours or from four (4) hours to 	three (3) hours), the employee affected will receive the following benefit payment for the remainder of the insurance contract year (October 1 - September 30) in which the reduction in hours occurs, unless the reduction in hours occurs after May&nbsp;1.</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li>7+ above ---(35 hrs/week) ---100% of Article 10 benefits</li>
					<li>6+ above ---(30-35 hrs/week) ---86% of Article 10 benefits</li>
					<li>4 and above ---(20-30 hrs/week) ---71% of Article 10 benefits</li>
					<li>Below 4 ------57% of Article 10 benefits</li>
				</ul>

				<li><p><!-- e. -->If the reduction in hours occurs after May 1 of any particular year, no change will be made in the employee's health and dental benefits until October 1, when the benefits will be those described in Article 10.</p></li>

				<li><p><!-- f. -->Whenever an employee's hours are reduced as a result of this Article, the supervisor shall inform the employee twenty (20) calendar days before the reduction in hours takes place.</p></li>

				<li><p><!-- g. -->Employees reduced in hours, such that the employee is reduced to a lower benefit level, shall be placed on an internal recall list for the job title they currently hold and will be offered, in classification seniority order, transfer to any opening within that job title that would restore them to the previous benefit level. They must respond within three (3) business days of any such offer. If they refuse the transfer, they will be removed from the recall list.</p></li>

				<li><p><!-- h. -->No regular employees will be laid off until all temporary employees within that job title have been terminated.</p></li>
	</ol>

	<h4>5.3</h4>
	<p>Recall</p>

		<ol type="a">
			<li><p><!-- a. -->Whenever the District determines that a regular vacancy exists within a job title or classification which has experienced a layoff/displacement (within the last twenty-seven (27) months), laid off/displaced employees from the job title or classification will be recalled in reverse order of layoff to a position for which they are qualified. The District agrees that no new employees will be hired for positions affected by a layoff until all laid off employees who are qualified to hold the positions have been given an opportunity to fill them.</p></li>

			<p>The Association agrees to assist the District in locating laid off employees. If the Association and District are unable to locate a laid off employee within ten (10) working days, or if a laid off employee is unable to report to work within ten (10) working days after being notified (except in the case of an emergency, such as a medical or health situation which prevents the presence of the employee), that employee will not be eligible to fill the vacant position and will be removed from the recall list.</p>

			<p>In the event two (2) or more laid off employees are equally qualified for a position, the employee will be offered the position in order of seniority in the District.</p>

			<li><p><!-- b. -->Employees on the recall list shall have the right to decline recall to any position which is not substantially equivalent to the position held prior to the layoff. Substantially equivalent shall mean at least eighty percent (80%) of the total 16 monetary compensations (wages x hours of the position previously held). Failure to accept recall to a substantially equivalent position will be treated as a voluntary resignation from District employment.</p></li>

			<li><p><!-- c. -->Except as provided for in Section 5.3(a), recall rights shall expire twenty-seven (27) months from the effective date of the layoff.</p></li>

			<li><p><!-- d. -->Any disagreements concerning application of this Article shall be resolved via the grievance procedure.</p></li>

			<li><p><!-- e. -->Employees who have bumped into a lower paying job title within their classification shall retain recall rights to their original job title within their classification through these recall provisions. Similarly, employees who have bumped back into a previously held job title shall retain recall rights to the job title from which they were displaced.</p></li>

<h4>9.1</h4>
	<p>Full-time employees will work a weekly average of eight (8) hours per day except for holiday or vacation provided in this agreement.  Although the "normal workweek" will be defined as Monday through Friday and/or those days on which students are in school attendance, the District may periodically assign employees to work Saturdays and/or Sundays for limited periods of time (emergencies, special events such as Saturday gym or Sunday church services, etc). Subject to District approval, employees may request to work weekends in addition to their normal workweek.  The working hours will be determined by the principal or supervisor.When there is a need for an employee, with prior approval by the supervisor, to work more than eight (8) hours a day or forty (40) hours a week, the employee and supervisor shall mutually agree beforehand if this time will be paid via overtime on the timecard or tracked at the building level for compensatory time off work.</p>

<ol type="A">
<li><!-- A. -->Overtime</li>
	<ol type="a">
	<li><!-- a. --><p>With prior approval of the supervisor, employees will receive one and one-half (1 1/2) times their established wage for all hours worked over forty (40) hours per workweek or eight (8) hours per day.  No employee will work beyond forty (40) hours per workweek or eight (8) hours in a day for overtime pay unless such time is preapproved by the principal or supervisor.</p></li>

	<li><!-- b. --><p>In emergencies, involving security of the building and when the supervisor or principal cannot be contacted, the District employee on duty and in charge of the building shall determine the necessity for overtime, not to exceed one (1) hour at any one occurrence.</p></li>
	</ol>
<li><!-- B. -->Compensatory Time</li>
	<ol type="a">
	<li><!-- a. --><p>With prior approval of the supervisor, all hours worked over forty (40) hours per workweek or eight (8) hours per day will be granted compensatory time off at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the amount of time worked.  Use of compensatory time shall be arranged with the employee's supervisor within sixty (60) calendar days of the date on which the compensatory time is earned.  This means the compensatory time must be scheduled but not necessarily taken within the sixty (60) days.</p></li>

	<li><!-- b. --><p>If compensatory time off is not arranged within the sixty (60) days, the affected employee will submit the hours for overtime pay.</p></li>
	</ol>
<li><!-- C. -->Flexible Time</li>

	<p>If, with supervisor approval, the employee works more than their regularly scheduled hours in a work day, they can request to flex their time on a different day that week with approval of their supervisor.  This flexing of time shall not exceed more than forty (40) hours worked in a single week.</p>

<li><!-- D. -->Additional Time</li>

	<p>With approval of the supervisor, when a less than full-time employee is required or asked to work beyond their regularly scheduled hours, they will be paid their hourly rate for the additional time.  If the employee works more than forty (40) hours in a week, the hours over forty (40) will follow the overtime or compensatory time guidance.</p>

<li><!-- E. -->On Call</li>
	<p>No employee shall be paid for less than two (2) hours of straight time or time and one half (1 1/2) for hours actually worked, whichever is greater, when called back to the job in emergency situations.</p>

<li><!-- F. -->Alternative Work Calendars</li>
	<ol type="a">
	<li><!-- a. --><p>Nothing in this Article shall prevent the District from scheduling employees to work on the weekend if the District adopts a schedule that creates a state student attendance day on the weekend.</p></li>

	<li><!-- b. --><p>Should an employee desire to work a four (4) day workweek (ten (10) hours/day), such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.  Any requests for the four (4) day workweek scheduled shall be approved by the Director of Human Resources and reviewed on an annual basis with the direct supervisor to ensure the schedule meets the needs of the District.</p></li>

	<li><!-- c. --><p>The District may establish an alternate five (5) day workweek for open positions and voluntary reassignments.  Each employee shall have an individual written work plan for work hours and days and holiday hours.</p></li>

		<li><!--D.--><p>Employees who are scheduled to work twelve (12) months may choose to use vacation or accumulated compensatory time to offset the loss of work days beyond the three granted for inclement weather or emergency closure when staff is instructed not to report to work.  If an employee does not have paid leave available, then the employee will be granted leave without pay and such leave will not be detrimental to the employee's attendance record.</p></li>
